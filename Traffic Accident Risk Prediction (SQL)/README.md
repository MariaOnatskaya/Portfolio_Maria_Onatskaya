# Traffic Accident Risk Assessment Model Development (SQL)

## Description:  
Developed and trained a model to predict the probability of traffic accidents based on historical data while considering the Clientâ€™s requirements.  

## Key Achievements:  
- Selected key factors influencing accident risk, including vehicle age, weather conditions, road surface, and time of day.  
- Conducted a seasonality analysis of traffic accidents and identified major causes such as speeding, improper turns, and driving under the influence.  
- Trained and tested multiple models, including DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, CatBoostClassifier, and LGBMClassifier.  
- Achieved the best results with LGBMClassifier (recall: 83%, F1-score: 66%).  
- Developed recommendations for accident prevention, including speed limiters, navigation alerts, alcohol impairment detection systems, and an accident database.  

## Tools:  
SQLAlchemy, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Pipeline, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, F1-score, Accuracy, Recall, Precision.
